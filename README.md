# Introduction

Once you've cloned the git repository, go into the root folder.
in FoodCesi\ open a new CMD and enter:

```
npm install
```

If it tells you there are some "high sevirity vulnerabilities", it's fine, this doesn't cause any trouble later on.\

Move then to the client folder:

```
cd ./client
```

run again:

```
npm install
```

Finally, start the client with

```
npm run serve
```

Then move to the FoodCesi/server folder:

```
cd ../server
```

There, run one last command:

```
node server.ts
```
